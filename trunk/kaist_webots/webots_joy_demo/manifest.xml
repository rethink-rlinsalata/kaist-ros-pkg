  <description brief="Webots joystick controller demo for ROS">
This is an example of a Webots Controller written in C++, running as a ROS Node. 
It demonstrates how to build a ROS package linked against the Webots CppLibrary, control a robot using ROS messages, and start the simulation from a single launch file.

The 'joy' node from the 'joystick_drivers' stack receives input from a USB joystick and publishes the state of the buttons and axes on the '/joy' topic.
This node uses that input to drive a simple simulated robot in Webots.
Speed commands are sent to the differential drive model using the Webots C++ API.

Tested with Webots 6.4.4, ROS Fuerte and Microsoft Xbox-360 joystick.
