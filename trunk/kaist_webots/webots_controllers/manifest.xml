  <description brief="Webots controllers for ROS">
The idea behind this package was to create a controller manager for Webots, similar to what is available for Gazebo. This would enable users to
easily test different position/velocity/force controllers with their simulation.

The launch file loads the 'webots_run' node which opens the specified world file in the Webots simulator, which in turn executes the controller binary.

At present, only a stand-alone P-controller has been implemented: joint_position_controller. The controller configuration is defined in a yaml file and this allows users to quickly implement a controller to test their new model. Position commands are received on a ROS topic for each joint, and position and velocity feedback is published on the /joint_states topic.

Tested with Webots 6.4.4, ROS Fuerte.
